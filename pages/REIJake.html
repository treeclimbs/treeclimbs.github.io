  <tr><td class="align-right">Description:</td><td class="align-left"><p>A large carbiner, but the round basket can force all attached objects to be pushed together, somewhat negating the benefits of a large basket. The markings are all forged onto the carabiner in high relief letters. The gate hinge is angled such that the gate opens just outside the main plane of the carabiner. Because it does not contact the carabiner spine, the gate can open further and provides a slightly larger gate opening that it would otherwise.</p><p>As climbing gained popularity post WWII, REI started producing or selling REI branded climbing equipment. Often these were manufacturered by another company, but sold under their name. MSR produced a line of carabiners for REI for many years, up through the 1990's. In fact these were part of an <a href="../references/Nagode-1995-microfractures-in-carabiners.pdf">oft-cited test</a> by Steve Nagode on the myth of microfactures.</p><p>This clearly takes the same shape as the later <a href="OmegaPacificOmegaJake.html">Omega Pacific Jake</a> but I have yet to determine if these were made by OmegaPac for REI, if the tooling for these carabiners was later sold to OmegaPac, or something else.</p><p> </p></td></tr>
