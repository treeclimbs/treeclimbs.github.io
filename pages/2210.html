  <tr><td class="align-right">Description:</td><td class="align-left"><p>In general, it is beyond the scope of the collection to include the huge array of oval carabiners which dominated rock climbing and vertical rope work for decades. This piece is included because it highlights a certain time in carabiner manufacturing through 3 key features - the nose is forged, the hinge and nose pins are recessed, and there is no strength rating present.</p><p>Other early carabiners used milled noses, like the <a href="1420.html">Climb High Oval</a>, but this design left the gate more susceptible to opening if pressed against a rock or other foreign object. The forged nose, was faster to produce, stronger and protruded to protect the gate against accidental opening. Virtually all modern carabiners protect the gate in a similar way.</p><p>Recesses pins and a lack of strength ratings are no longer the norm. Most modern carabiners use domed rivets for security (and easy inspection), although some manufacturers spin the rivets almost flush with the gate (see the <a href="OmegaPacificClassicStraightGate.html">Omega Pacific Classic</a>). Wiregate carabiners use a similar method to secure the ends of the wire. Flat spun rivets tend to have sharp edges which catch and pull on the fibers of softgoods, more so than more domed rivets. Recessed pins had no such issues, but could walk in one direct or the other without noticing and may not be as strong.</p><p> This carabiner came as part of a lot of SMC carabiners with close fitting brake bars. Without recessed pins, the brake bars would not slide onto the gate - which may have been a factor in the design.</p></td></tr>
