  <tr><td class="align-right">Description &amp; Commentary:</td><td class="align-left"><p>Another example of the latchless design. The gate does not seem to fit as well as my first example, especially the left side.</p><p> Pierre Allain was one of the earliest carabiner manufacturers, selling out of his shop in France. This model only has slanted faces at the gate, not a hook & pin or similar arrangement to allow the gate to share load when the carabiner is subjected to a load.</p><p>In 1965 Pierre Allain started individual testing, marking a tested carabiner with a pyramid punch next to the rating. As this example lacks the distinctive square/pyramid mark I believe it to be produced prior to 1965. See the <a href="2086.html">Pierre Allain (asymmetric D)</a> for an example with the punch.</p><p>The excellent site <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/caffmeux/mus%C3%A9e-de-lescalade-de-seb/matos/pierre-allain-1948-%C3%A0-1977/1958-mousqueton-pierre-allain">Les Caffmeux</a> has an image of the 1965 advertisement. Here is it translated into English (courtesy of Reddit user u/1_1_8_3):</p><p><div class="quote"><strong>THE NEW CARABINER 1965</strong></p><p><strong>PIERRE ALLAIN 1600kg</strong></p><p>This new carabiner (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevet%C3%A9_SGDG">SGDG patented</a>), made from a special light alloy <em>[referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7075_aluminium_alloy">7000 series aluminum/zinc alloy</a> marketed as "Zicral"]</em>, take its great resistance from its metal and the particular shape of its drawing that brings the point of support of the applied force very close to the main branch <em>[carabiner spine]</em>, which reduce as much as possible the length of the leverage arm.</p><p>With its maximum lightness (65g) and its breaking load (1600kg), the carabiner PIERRE ALLAIN reaches unmatched performances.</p><p>As an additional security measure and to remove any part that could have an hidden structural defect, <strong>each carabiner</strong> is tested at half its breaking load (800kg), remaining below its yield point.</p><p>To avoid any mistake, a punch (small square pyramid) is automatically struck during the trial, next to the 1600kg indication, as a proof that it has been tested.</p><p>This way you can check this mark on your new carabiners, and also appreciate the quality of operation of their metal gates.</p><p><strong>But BEWARE, to benefits from these advantages of operation and assurance, you have to ask your seller for the NEW CARABINER 1965, manufactured exclusively by PIERRE ALLAIN from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriage-les-Bains">URIAGE</a></strong></p><p>-----</p><p>EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of PIERRE ALLAIN 1956 carabiner, that was selected to equip the French expedition 1965 in Himalaya, PIERRE ALLAIN "Les Essarts" <em>[a locality]</em> Uriage (<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%C3%A8re">Is√®re</a>) </div></p><p>Also, reports in the National Speleological Society (NSS) and <a href="../references/MSR-newsletter-1970-May1.pdf">Mountain Safety Research (MSR - yes that MSR)</a> newsletters indicated that climbers had specifically experienced low-load failures of similar style of "carabiner" when loaded along the minor axis. Unlike those that failed, this example has a small stud on the gate, which may or may not provide additional minor axis strength.</p><p>Technically, without a load-bearing gate, I do not consider this a carabiner - rather a snap&#8209;hook. But it's just too neat of an artifact to not include here. </p></td></tr>
