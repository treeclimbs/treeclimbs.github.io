  <tr><td class="align-right">Description:</td><td class="align-left"><p>An old school steel oval which has been in production for decades. This one was left in a non-climate controlled building for a couple years in the bottom of a box of assorted defunct equipment - it's seen better days.</p><p>Notable here are two features: The claw lock gate, and a nose-stopped locking sleeve.</p><p>The gate and nose mate using a "clawlock" arrangement where a surface on the gate overlaps with another surface on the nose, rather than the more commonly found pin & hook or keylock styles. I have seen this style present on many steel carabiners, but no (rated) aluminum carabiners. My guess is that the soft aluminum would require a much larger surface/gate/nose to resist deformation.</p><p>The locking sleeve will rotate until fully jammed against the curvature of the nose of the carabiner, and can be difficult to loosen, specially after load. Users of such carabiners (such as me on my first ropes course job) were instructed to rotate the sleeve until it stopped, then back it off a quarter-turn. Modern screwlock carabiners have a stop integrated into the gate - usually a metal snap-ring hidden behind the locking sleeve. Gate-stopped screwlockers will still permit minor movement of the gate when locked. Nose stopped carabiners will have no movement at all with the locking sleeve jammed against the nose. </p></td></tr>
