  <tr><td class="align-right">Description &amp; Commentary:</td><td class="align-left"><p>The design is a basic D, slightly wider than the iconic <a href="1040.html">Black Diamond Light D</a>, with all the strengths and limitations of the design. It possesses all the features of D's of this time, an unshielded gate and a forged nose extending beyond the gate for strength, visual & tactile feedback of the gate orientation, and guards against accidental opening. Perhaps most notably with recessed domed rivets for the hinge and latch pins.</p><p>The round profile provides a higher strength rating at heigher weight than the similar flat profile <a href="3010.html">UNO 2100</a>.</p><p>Stamping on spine-left states UNO, which is the brand of carabiner. I acquired this as part of a larger lot of carabiner from Japan - spine-right is stamped 山洋スポ一ツ (Sanyō Sports), which was an outdoor shop located in Shibuya that also sold its own products. Currently, it seems to have changed its name to "Function Junction" and is in business at the same location. I do not know if this is the manufacturer or perhaps a whitelabel production.</p><p>From the Sanyō Sports/Function Junction website:</p><p><div class="quote">The founder, Hiroto Minami, was born in Sapporo, Hokkaido in 1931. He's one of Japan's top climbers, having made numerous first ascents, including the frontal route of the rock wall commonly known as Tsuitate-iwa (衝立岩) at Ichinokurasawa (一ノ倉沢) in Mt. Tanigawa (谷川岳) (1959). And he was also the actual model for Jiro Nitta's novel "神々の岩壁." His achievements have had a tremendous impact on later generations.</p><p>He opened a shop specializing in mountain goods and skis here in Shibuya, Tokyo, in 1962. He passed away at the age of 84.</div></p><p>Many thanks to the Reddit user u/rakudaruma for translating this information and helping me understand the current relationship between Sanyō Sports and Function Junction.</p></td></tr>
