      <h2 class="indextitle">Profile</h2>
      <p>
        Cross-sectional profile of the carabiner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some carabiners have a blend of profiles, with differnt cross-sections along the basket or spine. 
        In general, I try to categorize carabiners using the profile along the rope running surface or the profile which best represents the manfacturing method. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some styles can be murky to tease apart, especially if the profile is not consistant along the entire carabiner body:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p> 
          The <a href="pages/OmegaPacificOmegaJake.html">Omega Pacific Jake</a> typifies the T-Beam profile, 
          and the <a href="pages/BlackDiamondQuicksilver2screwgate.html">BD&nbsp;Quicksilver2</a> uses a similar profile with softened edges.
          I have classified the <a href="pages/PetzlSpiritv1b.html">Petzl&nbsp;Spirit&nbsp;v1</a> as a hollow-trapezoid shape, but evenly splits the difference between T-Beam and Trap. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          The <a href="pages/PetzlSpiritv2.html">Petzl&nbsp;Spirit&nbsp;v2</a> clearly uses an I-Beam (H-Beam) profile, but 
          the <a href="pages/BlackDiamondVaporlock.html">BD&nbsp;Vaporlock</a> softens those edges significantly, almost a hollow-trapezoid shape.
          And I've classified the <a href="pages/BlackDiamondDynotronv1.html">BD&nbsp;Dynotron&nbsp;v1</a> as an I-Beam, but it is essentailly a trapezoid shape with a minor groove.

      <h2 class="indextitle">Rivet Style</h2>
      <p>
        Most gates are attached to the carabiner body with some sort of rivet or pin. The ends of the wire in a wiregate are finished in a similar manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rivet is a pin with flared ends, that flaring can take different shapes which affects how the carabiner handles. 
        One end is usually pre-formed, and the other end formed once the carabiner has assembled.
        Most auto-locking carabiners use a (pre-formed) stud on one end of the hinge rivet to index the locking sleeve. In this case, this term describes the finished end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Admittedly, this term is somewhat subjective as styles represent a blend of both manufacturing methods and design choices, and some style are very similar.
        I consider an edge sharp if I can scrape off part of my fingernail against the rivet edge. In my experience, edges this sharp will pick and catch on rope fibers. 
        This does get murky on well-used carabiners with worn rivet edges.

      <h2 class="indextitle">Nose Guard</h2>
      <p>In conjunction with the gate spring tension, a guard helps protect an unlocked carabiner gate from opening if dragged (flat) across a (rock) surface.</p>
      <p>This feature may sometimes be referred to as a <em>hooded nose</em>, especially with wiregate carabiners.</p>

      <p>
        If loaded along the minor axis (crossloaded), the rear of the gate can rapidly shred a rope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older carabiners tended to have a large square cut-out, which clears debris and ice relatively easily, but may damage the rope under a heavy crossload.
        More modern designs have a smoother surface on the rear of the gate to prevent damage.
