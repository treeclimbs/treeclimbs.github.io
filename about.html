      <h2>Carabiner Collection Criteria</h2>
      <p>I have chosen to shape this personal collection with a few criteria given the availability of various carabiner models.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary interest and expertise is in tree climbing, which uses locking carabiners almost exclusively.
        As such, I primarily focus on the aquisition of locking carabiners, but non-lockers have been produced in far greater numbers, for much longer. 
      </p>
      <p>Non-lockers tend to highlight changes or dead-ends of carabiner design and seem to keep showing up in my collection...
        <em>(plus I'm not one to toss aside a carabiner even if it's a little boring).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Listed below in order of importance are the criteria I use to evaluate adding new carabiners, along with a few examples:</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="criterion">Mechanically Unique or Interesting</h3>
        <p class="about-page">
          My core interest and the core focus of the collection - by definition mostly secured/locking carabiners.

        </p>

      <h3 class="criterion">Discpline Demonstration</h3>
        <p class="about-page">Highlights a particular use unique or core to a particular rope discipline. 
          The tools look similar, but reveal differences in domain hazards and user needs.

        </p>
        <h3 class="criterion">Iconic or Industry Standard</h3>
        <p class="about-page">  They may be common, but were an early example of &quot;getting it right&quot; or the culmination of years of small changes in the industry.

          A complete range of carabiner designs from a particular company highlights how the company or climbing industry

        <h2>Disclaimer & Future Plans</h2>
        <p class="about-page">
          Yup, this is a personal page and project, which I maintain for fun as a hobby. 
          Carabiner information in parentheses () is placeholder info, and I'm researching the correct/original info. 
          This is most commonly found in carabiner names and version numbers.
          My apologies for any errors, if you see one or can point me to relevant information please <a href="https://www.bayareatreeclimbing.com/contact">reach out</a>.
          Opinions are my own, from the perspective of a tree climber, ropes course professional and reformed rock climber.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day I'll set up a proper lightbox and take some better photos with more even lighting and consistent focus.
          Right now, I'm focused on getting the information up in a somewhat accessible manner. 
          As the number of documented carabiners grow, I may need to split the index page into different pages based on type.
          I also need to read more industry papers to help refine some of the <a href="terminology.html">terminology</a> I
          use to describe design aspects, as well as classification criteria for those terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want access to the raw tabular data for some reason, <a href="https://www.bayareatreeclimbing.com/contact">that can be arranged</a>.
